              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Navprayas was established in April 2000 with a vision to create
                meaningful social change and contribute to the upliftment of our
                society. The founding members, driven by a shared commitment to
                improve the social, economic, and educational standards of their
                communities, laid the foundation for what would become a
                transformative force in local development.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Navprayas was initiated by Tejnarayan Prasad, Lalmani Prasad,
                Hari Shankar Nath, Jitendra Prasad, and Kauleshwar
                Prasadâ€”individuals who had been deeply involved in community
                work even before the formation of the organization. With years
                of experience and a strong desire to foster positive change,
                they came together to form Navprayas with the mission of raising
                awareness, providing educational opportunities, and empowering
                communities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                In 1999, the vision took form with the involvement of the other
                founding members, each contributing their unique skills and
                expertise. Their collective dedication and innovative approach
                allowed Navprayas to grow into a respected organization
                committed to improving the lives of individuals and communities
                across the region.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Now, after 25 years of dedicated service, Navprayas Foundation
                has had over 2000+ participants in its various programs and
                initiatives. The foundation has also built a strong network of
                over 700+ alumni, who continue to make significant contributions
                to their communities and serve as ambassadors of positive
                change. Since its inception, Navprayas Foundation has organized
